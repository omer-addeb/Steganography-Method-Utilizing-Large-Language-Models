He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his
I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I h
Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his over- powering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the sta
I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over however
At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.  "Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool
There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which
When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the
For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently
Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened enve- lope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had
On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from
My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recov- ered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round
You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.  "It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's.
Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier
so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch.
as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeav- oured in my case to do. If I remember right
But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round faced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The King uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but the soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King's wickedness. No one had ever come out of this torture chamber alive but this time the King
had to accept defeat even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go. He offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.  "I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding."  "That's fine with me," Martin said, and I accept your offer but as long as I pick the bag and the man who will carry it away. The poor
King was unaware of the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all of his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When they left court, the King had become very poor.  The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He called the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin.
Bring them back dead or alive and at all costs!" Later on, the soldiers caught up with the six young men and surrounded them.  "Give us back the gold and surrender," they demanded. But the fattest of the men began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a few minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the battalions were
noIt was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were wel- come to Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police headquarters. In return for the news which Lestrde would bring, Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case
and was able occasionally without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.  On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him. The first case reported was
It was at the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into fragments. He rushed out into the road
but, although sev- eral passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings and
The second case, however, was more serious, and also more singular. It occurred only last night. In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson's shop, there lives a well-known medical practi- tioner, named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames. His residence and principal consulting-room
This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Em- peror. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece
Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered fragments were discovered. Holmes rubbed his hands.
This is certainly very novel, said he. I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock, and you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been opened in the night, and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had been smashed to
It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night, and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house
It will ring in my ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only a plaster cast and
a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman standing over me in the hall. Well, who was the
There's nothing to show who he was," said Lestrade. "You shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed or whether
it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it is."  It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It represented an alert, sharp featured simian man. with thick eye- brows and a very peculiar projection of the lower
part of the face, like the muzzle of a baboon. We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you come?"  "Certainly. I must just take one look round." He examined the carpet and the window. "The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man
though I have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details. It's like my luck! You remember when the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to write it. And now I'll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep. As we left the room, we heard his pen

They were sitting on the paneled floor of Dave's new apartment. Mark, with his back to the droning heater, was closest to the balcony. The smoke from his cigarette drifted to the ceiling, where it lingered and slowly ebbed. Jamie was sipping a cola next to him. Dave was across from the two of them, sitting Indian-style. The walls of his apartment were painted in bland colors
They were in the living room, which had Dave's extensive stereo already plugged in and playing his AC/DC, but was otherwise completely bare. There were two doorways on the other side of the room, one which led to the bedroom and bathroom, the other to the kitchen, a small sitting room and eventually the front door. They'd been cleaning the place up and moving thing
which was about four o'clock, and were taking a break. The bed had been the hardest of all to bring in, for it had barely fit in the doorway. After that, they had moved Dave's small fridge, the stereo, a dresser and an assortment of breakables in. Jamie turned and looked at Mark, whose eyes were still fixed outside. It was late in the day and rush hour traffic was at its peak. Many

Engines rumbling, black smoke pouring from the stack, the locomotive clattered and roared through the California night. Dick was at the helm again, feeling proud and in control.

It was a little strange, though, to be here with everything so quiet and empty. There was no activity, no sound of servants and bureaucrats in the hallway, just a gentle hush from an air circulator. There was no paperwork on the desk, no tape recorder concealed inside. Nothing but a gold-plated pen which did not work (he had tested it on the end of a finger). That and a small
gray box, about the size and shape of a personal stereo from the nineteen eighties. Attached to the gray box with a flexible, coiled wire was what looked like a set of swim goggles with odd lumps and protuberances all along the headband. Nixon couldn't divine their purpose and when he held them to his eyes he found they were opaque. A gentle knock on the door interrupted Nixon's contemplation
It was surreal, harsh to Nixon's senses. Strange shapes littered a plane, in some places arranged with symmetry and order, in others, randomly jumbled. A low, gurgling hum seemed to come from everywhere at once. Moving about on this weird landscape were a multitude of what might have been cartoon representations of humans, or perhaps insects of some sort. Nixon
The scene shifted abruptly and Nixon found himself in a brightly vibrating computer simulation of his Oval Office. He looked at the desk and swivel chair and suddenly found himself seated there. In this world, the desktop was full, half a dozen documents arranged for easy viewing. He looked at the first one on the left and it expanded out to fill
What had seemed to be a document now appeared to be a small, empty, gray room occupied by a single androgynous figure. The features of the figure were stylized, a sort of generic young person, childlike but intelligent, short hair with a single forelock dangling over the forehead. The cartoon figure faced Nixon. It raised its right forefinger
The land of the dead is a place beyond space and time, presided over by a beautiful one at times in the shape of a vulture, at times in many other forms. The man had feet of clay, his life-force tied to flesh and earth and stone, too heavy to float free. It is impossible to move and drift like the beautiful ones when the connections to the world of matter and energy are still strong. in this

The man went back, his old body renewed by the time and place and everything flow of the life-force. Back to the throne he had left long ago. But no longer was he so tied to the ground, so hard and heavy and immobile. His dip into the other world, his bath in eternity, and the time and place of the life-force, had lightened him. At times he still longed for the solid stillness, the straight
But there was now enough light in him that his body and mind could read something of where he might go. He learned a pattern, not so much by study, but by unconscious tuition of the life-force. This was not always easy, for he had to learn how to die properly and, in a way, he died again and again, such a solution shouted black smoke. Each self that formed around the
The simulation of a woman which suddenly appeared in his office was quite attractive. In a vivid, cartoonish sort of way, she looked wholesome, American, friendly. She reminded Dick of Pat, way back when. She had light brown hair, falling to her shoulders with a slight, glamorous curl. Her dress, of a decent length, was checkered, red
The next document opened into an outdoor scene with a large, weatherbeaten American flag as a backdrop. In the center of the stage stood a paunchy, mostly bald man in his early fifties who wore thick glasses and a checkered flannel shirt. To one side of him was a woman with a ruffled blouse and long tweed skirt; to the other side was a lean young man in jeans and
In case our faces are not familiar, due to your long illness, let me just explain that my name is Clinton Oestrike, and these are my very good friends and associates, Henrietta Groote and Neal Severant. We represent the good, god-fearing people of America who voted to put you back in charge, Mr. President. We want to see America as it was, at the head of all nations, strong and proud.
Yes, Dick. A break is when a random bit of information from another file somehow intrudes into a text. Right in the middle of old Clinton's rant, there was something that sounded like it came from something else, some random words. I thought for a second that Oestrike had really lost it, all the way, but it was just a break. They happen quite a lot, actually. They're one of the most persistent

They don't know yet. What they have found is that the breaks seem to be increasing in frequency. This document may help to confirm that. Also, they have found strong parallels between cybernetic breaks and some of the processes of the human mind. One theory suggests that breaks are a sign that the cybernet is attempting to become self-aware. Another popular theory is that it's a kind of this

He sat for several minutes, sweating, his heart racing. This felt so familiar, a feeling from a long time ago. Was it love? Repulsion? Lust? Hormones? Nixon was confused. He'd only known Martha for a very short time, but he liked her. Really liked her. He didn't even know what she really looked like, but the simulation was so very nice. At the same time, there was something about
The big front door creaked open and Nixon stepped out onto the front steps. The sky was bright blue, a few puffy clouds sailing across it. A cool breeze tussled his hair. It felt strange and he reached up to stroke his head. A fine growth, sort of a junior crew-cut, covered his entire scalp. It covered everything, even the parts that had been bald for several
The first pale green flush of spring was beginning to show in the White House lawn, just visible through brown weeds and fallen leaves from seasons past. There was very little human litter, only natural disorder. Out across the lawn and the Ellipse, the Washington Monument gleamed in the sun. It was quiet except for wind and birdsong. in this

Someone was running toward them, along Constitution  Avenue. A man, apparent age in the late twenties, hair close-  cropped but textured, simply attired, was running desperately  toward the bus.

When the founding fathers chartered our great nation,"  Nixon said, "they had a set of values which were to guide the  union. These were not lightly considered things.

Tim displayed a perverse grin. "The founding fathers  wished to free the colonists from an oppressive government,"  he said.

The train station was a decrepit old place, a crumbling cinder block building surrounded by a badly abused patch of lawn. There were only a few motorized vehicles pulled up in  front, a thoroughly dented Checker Marathon and two small,  three-wheeled things that looked homemade. The rest of the  traffic, a thin but constant flow, was on foot or bicycle. pleace
It was a strange mix of people. There were some who Nixon quickly identified as spacers, many more who wore old-style clothing, and quite a few who fit no category that he could  understand. The first group looked uniformly young, average  age about twenty three, but with some small children present.  The old-earthers were of a wide range of ages, from infant to  over
The car lurched and they were rolling slowly out of the  station, pulling away from the cinder block building, slowly  accelerating and then moving pretty quickly and the sunlight  now golden with the end of day flickering through the trees.

One was a beautiful young woman, electric shining hair in  the glorious sun, another was an old hag, dim and gnarly in  the fading light. There was an old man who loved the beautiful  woman, a young man who craved perverse union with the hag.

Mrs. Hedges bustled in from another room. Nixon could now  see that she looked part oriental, part european, attractive  in a pleasant way.

Arc93 had provided an empty basement room, and Stu and  Diana had just enough time before the concert to do what they  needed to do. As Stu finished sweeping the floor, Diana set up  a small table in the center of the room and arranged a small  assortment of paraphernalia on it: a small drum, an incense  burner, candles, a wooden wand tipped with opal, a goblet, a short sword, and a flat disk on
Stu then made a simple compass from a length of twine and  a piece of chalk, drawing a perfect circle around most of the  room. He pulled a few things from his pocket and added them to  the collection on the makeshift altar: hard copies of the two  oracles concerning Nixon, a tarot card entitled 'The Magus',  a drawing of an ibis-headed egyptian god, and a small book
A long time ago, he had once slept on a water bed, in a  hotel room somewhere. It had been a little difficult to get  used to, but once he had, he slept like a baby. This wasn't a  water bed; it was a water room. The room measured about twenty  by twenty feet and the entire floor was covered with a thick,  gently undulating mattress. Pillows and comforters covered  much of the surface. Just inside the door was a small
They lay together, relaxed, dreamily aroused. What had  seemed a burning, all-consuming desire only a few minutes ago  was now a comfortable, slow excitation. Marcia's hand ran  lightly down the muscles of his back. His own hand explored  the tightening skin of a nipple, the warm curve of a breast.  Each movement, each sensation, seemed the
Diana set the drum on the altar and pushed a button on  the audio playback. Music came out, throbbing with a similar  beat, but orchestrated, rich and full. Their robes slid to the  floor. They held each other and danced, their bodies close,  her breasts brushing against Stu's chest, his erect penis  caressing the smooth skin of her abdomen. They danced like  this for a while, feel
Nixon was so comfortable, so involved with the sensations  of aroused bodies, that he thought nothing of it when Marcia  passed a hand-rolled cigarette to him. He watched the smoke  swirl upwards for a moment, then took it from her. "Fill your lungs with it," she said. "Hold it in."   He complied. The taste was pleasant, sweet and pungent.  He held it in for a long moment
They smoked together for a while, touching,  stroking, smoking. It felt like the right thing to do.   Marcia mounted him, and Nixon's pelvis instinctively  matched her leisurely rhythm. He allowed his hands to caress  her stomach, her ribs, her breasts. A powerful sensation, like  light that he could feel, seemed to spread from his cock,  through his hips,
If the force from his loins was pure white light, the  sensation from his head felt like rainbows, bursts of colors  riding champagne bubbles through his body.
