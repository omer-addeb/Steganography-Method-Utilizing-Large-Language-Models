I haven't felt so relaxed in months,' said Dianne as we walked hand-in-hand along the dirt road. We had just spent most of the day paddling around in the Waiorongomai Stream, which runs out of the valley of the same name. Dianne was an Australian hosteller, now on her third day at the hostel.  The hostel had been unusually busy the night before (eight people) and she wanted to spend her last day at Te Aroha away from people. I had suggested she try the Waiorongomai for a bit of skinny-dipping and soul-searching, but she didn't want
Since it was a warm March day and Dianne was well-spoken -- and was tall, blonde, and attractively built, with a sweet face besides -- I had gone along. (Well, what else could I do?)  The Waiorongomai Valley lay about six kilometres south of the hostel. I was wont to go there frequently, alone or in company.  When I went alone, I generally cycled. When I went with hostellers, I generally walked.  The walk this day -- out of town along the road that hugs the feet of the Kaimais, then turn off and walk along a dirt road through farms until the car park near the site of the old
gold battery --took about an hour. At the car park, we climbed over fallen rocks and forded the icy stream (a six-metre journey that washed away all the dust and sweat that the six-kilometre journey preceding it had coated on us) and struck off up the valley along one of the many paths that thread the area. Before long this brought us back to the stream, at the point where most local picnickers would stop. We did not stop, however, for my favourite spots were reachable only by people willing to wade upstream a considerable distance, and involved a bit of
This was not a drawback, for without these obstacles there would have been nowhere in the valley worth bathing nude. Too many casual passers-through would have spoiled it. Eventually we reached the nearer of my two preferred spots -- a swirl-pool about ten metres across, with a wide area in the middle where the water was too deep to stand in. When I first came there it was much smaller, but I could see the ruins of a rock-dam at the downstream exit. With great labour I had rebuilt the dam, replacing the large boulders that some flood had washed away
Some boulders bigger than a bull had been so balanced that with just a little sapping I was able to topple their round bellies into the holes dug for them and so bring their flat tops into perfect position for sunning on. Although several paths ran along the valley walls on either side, I had satisfied myself that this spot, at least, was overlooked by none of them, unless someone cared to scramble down a muddy slope with no guarantee of getting back up again. Arrived, we stripped off and dived in. I was first out again, and was vastly amused by Dianne's expres
But I grinned at her and dived back in to show that it wasn't that bad. That bad or no, despite vigourous swimming and paddling, ten minutes of the water was more than enough, and we crawled out. I had arranged two rocks side-by-side, with a third facing them, all within easy distance for quiet conversation. After the water, the sensation of sun-warmed rock against my back and mild autumn sun on my face was bliss. And so we lay there, in the green-walled grey stone valley, baking slowly, talking in the relaxed way that the location allowed.
There was something about the calls of the birds and the occasional crackles and louder rustling of the greenery, and the chuckling of the water as it flowed over rocks and falls, that denied the outside world access to the valley. Problems and worries washed away with the water, down and away, out of sight and out of mind. Dianne was in NZ on the first stopover of a trip that would take her to the US and back via the Pacific Islands. She had just broken with her husband, and hoped to use the trip to regain her own identity and rest up preparatory
to building a new life when she returned to Oz. And after that she was open to the aura of the valley and we talked more and more freely and openly, while her cares fell off her and slithered dryly into the stream and were washed away. The afternoon wore on, pleasantly. She shifted to the facing-stone to change the angle of the sun. We had been discussing the effects of travel on body and nerves, and she mentioned that before her separation she had been quite a bit overweight. Since beginning her trip, the excess weight had dissolved, and she now weighed less than she had
She did look good, with just a little looseness of the skin at waist and thigh and upper arm, and I said so. I wonder about the therapeutic effects of travel sometimes -- for hostellers seem to me much healthier than the average person. Is it that the hostelling way of life attracts healthy people, or is it the way of life that attracts the health? From conversations with Dianne and other hostellers, I suspect the latter. And I certainly couldn't complain while facing this nude, golden woman with her bronzed skin and translucent yellow hair. after these days we will
Consideration of which led me to go for another swim to help me keep my Scout's Promise to her. The sun fell below the valley rim, and the breeze blowing up the valley, pleasant in the sunshine, became cool enough to encourage activity. So we gathered up our gear and waded downstream. At the first bend we stopped to dress, for we were no longer in that small spot which was safe from random eyes, and then continued downstream, hand in hand. We held hands, in fact, until we were out of the valley and partway down the dirt road. and all
Then, shazoom! I felt myself become a hostel manager again, and Dianne remembered that she didn't like to be touched by men, and our hands fell apart. The next day Dianne moved on, and although I have a contact address for her, I have never seen her again. Yet for that single day we were just two people, not a man and a woman (though we were aware of our natures), and I think that I would not have swapped the experience for a month of sex. I think that she felt the same. Before writing this account, I had many doubts. Not about the experience, but about the retailing of it to others. But it is just
An official of the Branch ferried me down the coast and stayed a few days to show me the ropes, then left me in sole charge, to sink or swim. The hostel was located in King Street, a fair walk from the centre of town. The building was an old two-storey wooden structure, long overdue for demolition.  But the nature of YHA's tenancy on the site was such that if it attempted to replace the building, the land would revert to the local council -- which was unlikely to grant a new lease on terms which would leave the hostel a financially viable proposition.
This attitude that there was `nothing to see or do' at Whakatane was mistaken. In fact, there was an excellent beach at nearby Ohope (Oh-Hope- ay) (a five-kilometre walk, unfortunately); there was a good walkway with several Maori sites along it; and Whakatane was a natural gateway for trampers wanting to get into areas not much frequented by other trampers. In addition to this, it was a good base for exploring the coastal side of Mt Tarawera (Tah-rah-weh-raa) and its little cousin Mt Edgecumbe, provided you had access to a car. Whakatane itself was the landing-place of one of the seven great canoes
I remember relatively little about my time at Whakatane -- except for details that are just as true for my next hostel and hence, perhaps, best left for now. Every attempt to dredge a single memory of everyday life at Whakatane also brings up several similar but better memories of the later hostel. On the other hand, a few distinct events do stand out. One day the hostel had a single visitor . I am unable to place the memory precisely in time: the YHA person who had brought me down to Whakatane was there, but it was probably a later visit for him. Anyway, we had been sitting round talking
It is a town of heavy industry, boasting two major pulp & paper mills -- Caxton and Tasman. The former produces most of NZ's toilet paper; the second produces the bulk of NZ's newsprint. Both are hulking complexes of concrete buildings and mazes of noisy machinery, employing thousands of workers between them, and they are the main reason the town exists. Because of this, the town looks a bit different to most NZ country centres, with its grid of uniformly utilitarian company houses and its odd lack of other
Somewhere around here we stopped to check in with the Forest HQ, since Mt Edgecumbe is located in the forest, most of which is privately owned by the mills. The mountain looms over Kawerau like an enormous pyramid, drawing the eye towards it as an escape from the endless rows of spiky trees. The forest road led us partway up the mountain, then ended in a parking lot. A wide gravel road continued on the far side of a locked gate, and we walked up the road. The day was warmish, despite the increasing height and the fact that it was mid-winter. Kurt later
They show me wearing T-shirt and thin trousers. Some clouds were scattered around, but not so many as to shut out the warmth of the sun. We eventually crossed the edge of the crater, but the highest point of the mountain was across the crater from where we did so. So we got to walk around the small weed-grown lake that fills the lowest section of the crater. The entire interior of the crater was heavily overgrown, and it was hard to reconcile all this life with the aridity that must have prevailed in the days when the volcano was active. I said earlier that Edgecumbe is dormant.
Turning right and looking out into Bay of Plenty, I could see another mountain -- this one low-lying and well up on the lip of the horizon. A pall of white cloud was rising from it. White Island is an active volcano about fifty kilometres offshore in the Bay. Once it was used as a quarry for sulphur, but increasing volcanism in the early years of this century rendered it too dangerous for anyone to reside and work there. Today it suffers occasional forays from planes and boats filled with curiosity- seekers. In 1985 the
I found myself looking at a spine of rock extending from the mountaintop. It rose a little higher than the rest of the summit. Not being afraid of heights, I immediately clambered out onto it and had my photo snapped, standing astride the end of the spur and pointing grandly in the direction of Whakatane. There are some hostellers waiting on the front porch of the hostel!' I shouted back to the others, jokingly. Actually, although the town was quite distinct, it was too far away for me to make out more than a couple of the bigger buildings and those only
I still possess a small phial of water and another of sand, collected during that visit. The water, by now, has lost enough substance through the small cork used to close the bottle so that it is brine rather than water. But who cares, My father worked for the NZ Post Office and had managed to secure one of the PO's many holiday cottages for this vacation. Ohope in summer was paradisiacal for the younger me. I would spend the long days exploring the beach and the surrounding area, and paddling and swimming, and building huge sand
The sand at Castlecliff Beach, which is the suburb of Wanganui my parents live in, is black well, grey when dry and heavy because of the presence of large quantities of iron. Remember the physics demonstration which involves a magnet and a handful of iron filings, We didn't need iron filings for that -- just a pail of sand.  I was very sad when the time came to leave, back to school and homework and `Get up, you'll be late, I never have liked getting up early. Perhaps that holiday has stayed in my memory so long because of a gim
We waited, car packed, until dawn lit the sky at the right-hand end of the bay. When the sun rose above the peaks of the East Cape, we all piled into the car and started the homeward trip. We drove across the island via Rotorua, and National Park, arriving in Wanganui before sunset. Then we went down to Castlecliff beach and watched the sun go down into the sea. From water, to water. After a somewhat uncertain start -- I needed time to adjust my viewpoint from that of the hosteller to that of the Manager -- I got the hang of the job, and even began to feel that perhaps this job provided an interes
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be  called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on  me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with  direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put  them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my  advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not  remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,  and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to  the latter
But you, or your interpolator,  ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it  not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master  Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my  knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,  she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the  first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of  Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,  in the account of the Academy of Projectors,
When I formerly hinted to you  something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you  were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful  over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every  thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But  pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about  five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of  the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time  when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of
as if these were brutes,  and those the rational creatures And indeed, to avoid so monstrous  and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement  hither. Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,  and to the trust I reposed in you.  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,  in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of  you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my  travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired  you to cons
I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to  confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and  returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of  the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since  the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I  have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there  should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but  shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to  adjust it as they please. I hear some of
I cannot help it. In my  first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest  mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found  that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled  in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I  remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so  altered that I could hardly understand the new.  And I observe, when  any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,  we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner
Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far  degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well  known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example  of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years  (although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that  infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so  deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the  Europeans. I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious
I must freely  confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature  have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and  particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else  I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming  the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary  schemes for ever. The author of these Travels, Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient  and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the  mother's side.
Gulliver, growing weary of  the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,  made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in  Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet  in good esteem among his neighbors. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his  father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from  Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at  Banbury, in that county, several tombs
I have carefully perused them three times: the style is  very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the  author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the  author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of  proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,  to say it was as true as if. By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the  author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to
This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not  made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and  tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several  voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of  the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of  the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend  that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved  to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of  readers. and i must
However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me  to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any  traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came  from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him. My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third  of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen  years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my  studies: but the charge of maintaining me (although I had a very  scanty allowance) being too
James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom  I continued four years; and my father now and then sending me small  sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts  of the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I  always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do. Bates, I went down to my father; where, by the  assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got  forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me  at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and
But, my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few  friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer  me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having  therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I  determined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two  ships, and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West  Indies, by which I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of  leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and modern
The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary  of the sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I  removed from the Old jury to Fetter-Lane, and from thence to Wapping  hoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to  account. After three years expectation that things would mend, I  accepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master  of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South-Sea. We set sail  from Bristol May 4, 1699, and our voyage at first was very prosperous. could see nothing except the sky.
It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with  the particulars of our adventures in those seas: let it suffice to  inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we  were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen's  Land. By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30  degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate  labor and ill food, the rest were in a very weak condition. On the  fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts,  the weather being very
Six of the crew, of  whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to  get clear of the ship, and the rock. We rowed by my computation  about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being  already spent with labor while we were in the ship. We therefore  trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour  the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of  my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the  rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they  were all lost. For my own part, I swam as
I often let my legs drop, and could  feel no bottom: but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no  longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was  much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile  before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock  in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could  not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so  weak a condition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely  tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and
I lay down on the grass, which was very short and  soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my  life, and, as I reckoned, above nine hours; for when I awakened, it  was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir  for, as I happened to he on my back, I found my arms and legs were  strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was  long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt  several slender ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my  thighs. I could only look upwards
In a little  time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing  gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when bending  my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human  creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a  quiver at his back. In the meantime, I felt at least forty more of the  same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the  utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a  fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were
However, they  soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full  sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of  admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, Hekinah degul:  the others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew  not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may  believe, in great uneasiness: at length, struggling to get loose, I  had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that  fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my  face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me,
But the  creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them;  whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after  it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, Tolgo phonac; when in an  instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,  which pricked me like so many needles; and besides they shot another  flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I  suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face,  which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of  arrows was
I thought it the most prudent method to lie still,  and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand  being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the  inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the  greatest armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the  same size with him that I saw. When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more  arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and  about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a  knocking for above
But I should have mentioned, that before the principal  person began his oration, he cried out three times, Langro dehul san  (these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained  to me). Whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and  cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave  me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person  and gesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle  age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him,  whereof one was a page that held up his train
He acted every part of an orator, and I could  observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity,  and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive  manner, lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun, as  calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger,  having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I  found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not  forbear showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of  decency) by putting
The Hurgo (for so they call a great lord, as I  afterwards learned) understood me very well. He descended from the  stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my  sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked  towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been  provided, and sent thither by the King's orders, upon the first  intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of  several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There  were shoulders, legs, and loins
I ate them by  two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the  bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as they could, showing a  thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I  then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating  that a small quantity would not suffice me, and being a most ingenious  people, they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest  hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top; I  drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not  hold half
They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in  the same manner, and made signs for more, but they had none to give  me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and  danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first,  Hekinah degul. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two  hogsheads, but first warning the people below to stand out of the way,  crying aloud, Borach mivola, and when they saw the vessels in the air,  there was a universal shout of Hekinah degul. I confess I was often  tempted, while they were go and
But the remembrance of what I had felt, which  probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of  honor I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive behavior, soon  drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as  bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me with  so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could  not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive  mortals, who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of  my hands was at liberty
After some time,  when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there  appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg,  advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue. And producing his credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied  close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger,  but with a kind of determinate resolution; often pointing forwards,  which, as I afterwards found
I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made  a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but  over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train)  and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my  liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook  his head by way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to  show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other  signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough,  and very good treatment.
Whereupon I once more thought of attempting  to break my bonds, but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows  upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the  darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number  of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they  might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the Hurgo and his  train withdrew with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon  after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words,  Peplom selan
But before this, they had daubed my face  and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the  smell, which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows. These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by  their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to  sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and  it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's order, had  mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine. It seems that upon the first moment I was discover
This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am  confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like  occasion; however, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as  generous. For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with  their spears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly have  awakened with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused  my rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings  wherewith I was tied; after which, as they were not able to make  resistance
This prince has several  machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great  weights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine  feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried  on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five  hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to  prepare the greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised  three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide,  moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was
It was brought parallel to me as I lay. But the  principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty  poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and  very strong cords of the bigness of packthread were fastened by  hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my  hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were  employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles,  and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the
Fifteen  hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and  a half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which,  as I said, was half a mile distant. About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very  ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while to  adjust something that was out of order, two or three of the young  natives had the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep;  they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face,  one of them, an officer in the Guards, put the sharp
We made a long march the remaining part of that  day, and rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of  me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot  me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise we continued  our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates  about noon. The Emperor, and all his court, came out to meet us; but  his great officers would by no means suffer his Majesty to endanger  his person by mounting on my body. At the place where the carriage stopped, there stood an ancient  temple, esteemed
In this edifice it was determined I should  lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet  high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep. On  each side of the gate was a small window not above six inches from the  ground: into that on the left side, the King's smiths conveyed  fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady's watch in  Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six  and thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side of  the great highway, at twenty feet
Here the Emperor ascended with many principal  lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was  told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a hundred  thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; and in  spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten  thousand, at several times, who mounted upon my body by the help of  ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain  of death. When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break  loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon
But the  noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk, are  not to be expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two  yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards  and forwards in a semi-circle; but, being fixed within four inches  of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in  the temple. When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must  confess I never beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country round  appeared like a continued garden, and the inclosed fields
These fields were intermingled with woods of half a sting, and the  tallest trees, as I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I  viewed the town on my left hand, which looked like the painted scene  of a city in a theatre. I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of  nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last  unburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency  and shame. The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my  house, which I accordingly did; and shut
But this was the only time I was ever guilty  of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid  reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially  considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my  constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business  in open air, at the full extent of my chain, and due care was taken  every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be  carried off in wheelbarrows, by two servants appointed for that  purpose.
I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance, that  perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous, if I had not  thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness  to the world; which I am told some of my maligners have been  pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question. When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house,  having occasion for fresh air. The Emperor was already descended  from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had  like to have cost him
When he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration, but kept  without the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers,  who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they  pushed forward in a sort of vehicle upon wheels till I could reach  them. I took these vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them  were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former  afforded me two or three good mouthfuls, and I emptied the liquor of  ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle,  drink
The Empress,  and young Princes of the blood, of both sexes, attended by many  ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident  that happened to the Emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his  person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the  breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to  strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and  masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive,  his countenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his
He was then past his  prime, being twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he  had reigned about seven, in great felicity, and generally  victorious. For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my  side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three  yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and  therefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very  plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the  European; but he had on his head a light helmet
He held his sword drawn in  his hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was  almost three inches long, the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched  with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate,  and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies and  courtiers were all most magnificently clad, so that the spot they  stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread on the ground,  embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His Imperial Majesty  spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither of us
There were several of his priests and lawyers  present (as I conjectured by their habits) who were commanded to  address themselves to me, and I spoke to them in as many languages  as I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch,  Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca; but all to no  purpose. After about two hours the court retired, and I was left  with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the  malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as  near as they dare, and some of them had the impudence to shoot their  arrows
But the colonel ordered six of  the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as  to deliver them bound into my hands, which some of his soldiers  accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends of their  pikes into my reach; I took them all in my right hand, put five of  them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as  if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the  colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw  me take out my penknife: but
I treated the rest in the  same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket, and I observed  both the soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my  clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court. Towards night I with some difficulty got into my house, where I  lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during  which time the Emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages,  and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty
By the same computation they  provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for  one who had been so long inured to hardships as I. As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought  prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so  that the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage  and household affairs must have ensued, if his Imperial Majesty had  not provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against  this inconveniency. He directed that
In the meantime, the Emperor held frequent councils to debate what  course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a  particular friend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to  be as much in the secret as any, that the court was under many  difficulties concerning me.  They apprehended my breaking loose, that  my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine.  Sometimes  they determined to starve me, or at least to shoot me in the face  and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon dispatch me: but  again
In the midst of these consultations, several officers  of the army went to the door of the great council chamber; and two  of them being admitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six  criminals above mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in  the breast of his Majesty and the whole board in my behalf, that an  Imperial Commission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine  hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six  beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together  with a propor
For this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes, seldom,  except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his  subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own  expense.  An establishment was-also made of six hundred persons to be  my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and  tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door. It was  likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit  of clothes after the fashion of the country: that six of his Majesty
All these orders were duly put in  execution, and in about three weeks I made a great progress in  learning their language; during which time the Emperor frequently  honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in  teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and  the first words I learned were to express my desire that he would  please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees. His  answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a work of  time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council
However, that I should be used with  all kindness; and he advised me to acquire, by my patience and  discreet behavior, the good opinion of himself and his subjects. He  desired I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper  officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several  weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the  bulk of so prodigious a person. I said, his Majesty should be  satisfied, for I was ready to strip myself, and turn out my pockets  before
He  replied, that by the laws of the kingdom I must be searched by two  of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my  consent and assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my  generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands: that  whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country,  or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them.  I took up the two  officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then  into every other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another  secret pocket I had no answor
In  one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small  quantity of gold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and  paper about them, made an exact inventory of everything they saw;  and when they were through, desired I would set them down, that they  might deliver it to the Emperor. This inventory I afterwards  translated that into English, and is word for word as follows.   Imprimis, In the right coat pocket of the Great Man Mountain for so  I interpret the words Quinbus Flestrin after the strictest search, we
In the left  pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal,  which we the searchers were not able to lift. We desired it should  be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid  leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set  us both sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat  pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded  one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong  cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly
In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of  which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the palisades before  your Majesty's court; wherewith we conjecture the Man-Mountain combs  his head, for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we  found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large  pocket on the right side of his middle cover so I translate the  word ranfu-lo, by which they meant my breeches we saw a hollow pillar  of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of  timber, larger
In the left pocket, another engine of the  same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round  flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the  white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my  comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two  black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty,  reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One  of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end  of the other, there appeared a white round substance, about twice  the bigness
I entreated his Imperial  Majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as  possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next  day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition;  they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the  edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by  a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for  above half an English mile: but the ground in that country being  extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected.
Within each of these was enclosed a  prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to  show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He  took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his  practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and to cut his meat  with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these  he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of  his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out  of the right fob hung a great silver chain
We directed him to draw out whatever was  fastened to that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and  half of some transparent metal: for on the transparent side we saw  certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch  them, till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance. He  put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise like that  of a watermill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or  the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter  opinion, because he
From the left fob he took  out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open  and shut like a purse, and serve him for the same use: we found  therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real  gold, must be of immense value. Having thus, in obedience to your Majesty's commands, diligently  searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of  the hide of some prodigious animal; from which, on the left side, hung  a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch
In one of these cells were several globes or balls  of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and  requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a  heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we  could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands. This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the  Man-Mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to your  Majesty's commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the  eighty-ninth moon of your Majesty's auspicious
When this inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me,  although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several  particulars. He first called for my scimitar, which I took out,  scabbard and all. In the meantime he ordered three thousand of his  choicest troops who then attended him to surround me at a  distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge: but I  did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He  then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some  rust by the sea water
I did so,  and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and  surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their  eyes as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His Majesty, who  is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he  ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground  as gently as I could, about six foot from the end of my chain. The  next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he  meant my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well
The astonishment  here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds  fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the Emperor,  although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in some  time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had  done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him  that the former might be kept from the fire, for it would kindle  with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air. I likewise delivered up my watch
He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the  motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their  sight is much more acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his  learned men about him, which were various and remote, as the reader  may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not  very perfectly understand them. I then gave up my silver and copper  money, my purse with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;  my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my hand
I had, as I before observed, one private pocket which escaped  their search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles which I  sometimes use for the weakness of my eyes , a pocket perspective,  and several other little conveniences; which, being of no  consequence to the Emperor, I did not think myself bound in honor to  discover, and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I  ventured them out of my possession. My gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the Emperor and  his court, and indeed upon the army and people in general
The  natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my  hand. And last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at  hide and seek in my hair. I had now made good progress in  understanding and speaking their language. The Emperor had a mind  one day to entertain me with several of the country shows, wherein  they exceeded all nations I have known, both for dexterity and  magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the  rope-dancers, performed
Upon which I shall desire  liberty, with the reader's patience, to enlarge a little. This diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates  for great employments and high favors at court. They are trained in  this art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or  liberal education. When a great office is vacant either by death or  disgrace which often happens five or six of those candidates  petition the Emperor to entertain his Majesty and the court with a  dance on the rope, and whoever jumps the highest without fall
Very often the chief ministers themselves  are commanded to show their skill, and to convince the Emperor that  they have not lost their faculty. Flimnap, the Treasurer, is allowed  to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than  any other lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset  several times together upon a trencher fixed on the rope, which is  no thicker than a common packthread in England. My friend Reldresal,  principal Secretary for Private Affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am  not partial, the
These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof  great numbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three  candidates break a limb. But the danger is much greater when the  ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity; for by  contending to excell themselves and their fellows, they strain so far,  that there is hardly one of them who has not received a fall, and some  of them two or three. I was assured that a year or two before my  arrival, Flimnap would have infallibly broken his neck, if one of  the King's cushions, that accidentally
There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before  the Emperor and Empress, and first minister, upon particular  occasions. The Emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads  of six inches long. One is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the  Emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor.  The  ceremony is performed in his Majesty's great chamber of state, where  the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity very different
The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having  been daily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to  my very feet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand  as I held it on the ground, and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, upon  a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a  prodigious leap. I had the good fortune to divert the Emperor one  day after a very extraordinary manner. I desired he would order  several sticks two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane,  to be brought me; whereupon his
