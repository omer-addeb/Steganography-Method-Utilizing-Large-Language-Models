Program Implementation Guide
Step 1: Launch the Program
Execute the provided Jupyter notebook file (text_steganography_using_GPT_2.ipynb). Upon running, the program will prompt you to:

Enter the secret message you wish to conceal.

Automatically compress the input using the Huffman coding algorithm.

Display the compressed binary output, representing the encoded version of your secret text.

Step 2: Provide Seed Text
Next, the program will request a seed text—a starting phrase or context to guide the AI in generating a natural-looking cover text. This ensures the output blends seamlessly with ordinary content.

Step 3: Retrieve and Share the Steganographic Output
Once processing completes, the program will generate and display the steganographic text—a seemingly innocuous passage containing your hidden data. You may then securely transmit this text to the intended recipient.

Key Features
Efficient Compression: Huffman coding minimizes the binary footprint of your secret message.

AI-Powered Concealment: GPT-2 generates contextually coherent cover text to evade detection.

User-Friendly Workflow: Clear prompts guide you through each step.

Decryption Process
Step 1: Launch the Decryption Program
Execute the google colab notebook file text_steganography_using_GPT_2_decoding.ipynb to initiate the decryption process.

Step 2: Input the Cover Text

When prompted:
Provide the steganographic text (cover text) containing the hidden message

The program will automatically process the input to extract the concealed data

Step 3: Retrieve the Secret Message

The system will:

Analyze the provided text

Decode the embedded information

Display the extracted secret message in its original form

Key Features:

Automated extraction process for seamless operation

Preserves original message integrity

No additional user input required beyond the initial cover text

Note: Ensure the cover text remains unaltered from its original encoded form to guarantee successful decryption.
